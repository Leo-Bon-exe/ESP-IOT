# IoT Application

This project uses an ESP microcontroller to measure current and voltage for real-time energy monitoring. It calculates power consumption and displays the cost through a mobile IoT application.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Measures current and voltage from connected devices.
Energy and Cost Calculation: Tracks power usage and calculates the cost.
Mobile Integration: Displays data via a mobile application.
IoT-Based Solution: Uses WiFi to transmit data for remote access.
